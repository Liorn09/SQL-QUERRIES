Selecting title and minimum revenue from a list of movies contained in a movie table, say we want to know the lowest revenue 
on the movies based on the original language they were created in.

SELECT title, MIN(revenue), original_language
FROM movies
GROUP BY original_language
LIMIT 35

Same thing can be done for MAX

Selecting title and minimum revenue from a list of movies contained in a movie table, say we want to know the lowest revenue 
on the movies based on the original language they were created in.

SELECT title, MIN(revenue), original_language
FROM movies
GROUP BY original_language
LIMIT 35

Same thing can be done for MAX


In this particular querry, I was trying to find the total number of movies produced by a production company called 'Pixar Animation Studios'
Two other tables where provided which included production company details with a table that mapped them to the movies table
Below was the querry I used;

SELECT pn.production_company_name, count(m.movie_id) AS "Count of movies"
FROM productioncompanies pn, productioncompanymap pm, movies m
WHERE m.movie_id = pm.movie_id
    AND pm.production_company_id = pn.production_company_id
        AND pn.production_company_name= 'Pixar Animation Studios'
GROUP BY pn.production_company_name, pm.production_company_id
